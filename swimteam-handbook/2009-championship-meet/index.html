<p>This years Championship Meet is hosted by the Buffalo Grove&nbsp; "Hurricane" on July 23rd.</p>
<p>There are 18 to 20 teams in the NISC but only 5 other teams that have advanced to the "A" Division (6 teams in total compete in this one meet)</p>
<p>Buffalo Grove will be the host to the 5 other teams in the &ldquo;A&rdquo; Division. Not all of our swimmers can participate in this meet. There are fewer heats and we are only allowed 2 swimmers&#47;event and only 1 relay&#47;age group. We have 5 Wednesday night meets and 3 Saturday morning meets where anyone on the team may participate. The 2 Away meets are usually the easiest for swimmers to swim more events. Parent Participation is the key to a successful home and away meet. We will need more volunteers for our home meets. The competition pool will always be closed to the public during a home meet.</p>
<p>Please consider volunteering in our June 18th & July meets, we now have an on line "Parent Volunteer" doc in the "Meet Sign Up" where you can pick out where you may wish to help at a meet</p>
<p>It is at the discretion of the coaches as to who will swim in the July 23rd Championship Meet. This is a team event. The coaches place swimmers in the limited events to balance entries in all age groups and to obtain the highest possible points in the meet. The Line ups for this event take many hours to coordinate with all the swimmers, coaches, and parents .</p>
<p>Swimming in a championship meet is a privilege, not a right or entitlement. When a swimmer has been entered in a championship meet there are many people counting on them. To decide not to come after line-ups have been sent is an extreme inconvenience and disappointment for all the coaches and swimmers involved in that meet line up. Swimmers cannot be substituted after the entries have been made. If your swimmer is entered in the meet, please send them ready to swim!</p>

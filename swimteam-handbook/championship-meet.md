The 2017 "A" Division Championship Meet is being hosted by the  MT. PROSPECT on July 26TH.  All teams in "A" division will compete.

Our parents and staff may be asked by the host to  volunteer to time or put labels on our own awards.  Parent  Participation is the key to a successful meet.  We will need a few volunteers for this meet. Their entire pool will be closed on this day  . Please volunteer in our June & July meets in order to find what you will do at our championship meet.

Tents, sleeping bags, healthy food, and clothing are especially important at this meet.

We have a one way bus scheduled to take swimmers and parents to the meet. Warm ups are usually 12:30 to 2:30. The start time is 3 pm. Each team will have 1 lane approximately 2 hours prior to the start of the meet for warm ups. We have each age group warm up separately for 20-30 minutes during their allotted time.

It is at the discretion of the coaches as to who will swim in the championship meet. Swimming in a championship meet is a privilege, not a right or entitlement. When a swimmer has been entered in a championship meet there are many people counting on them. To decide not to come after line-ups have been sent is an extreme inconvenience and disappointment for all the coaches and swimmers involved in that meet line up. If a swimmer is entered in the meet, please send them ready to swim!

On meet days swimmers should bring warm clothing since it tends to get chilly in the late afternoon & evening. Please have all articles of clothing marked with swimmers name and team. Sleeping bags and blankets are encouraged for all meets.  All swimmers must check in and out with their coach at home and away meets.

Swimmers should bring a healthy snacks or money to purchase food.

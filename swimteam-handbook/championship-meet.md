This years Championship Meet (2015) will be hosted by the Lincolnwood Lightning on July 22nd.

There are 18 to 20 teams in the NISC but only 5 other teams that have advanced to the "A" Division (6 teams in total compete in this one meet)There are fewer heats in the championship meet and we are only allowed 2 swimmers/event and only 1 relay/age group. We have 5 Wednesday night meets and 3 Saturday morning meets where anyone on the team may participate. The 2 Away meets are usually the easiest for swimmers to swim more events.

Our parents and staff will be the host to 5 other teams in the &ldquo;A&rdquo; Division. <a href="/meet-signup.html">Parent Participation</a> is the key to a successful meet. We will need more volunteers than a regular home meet. The entire pool will be closed on this day and we will begin setting up on Tues the night before.

Please consider volunteering in our June 17th &amp; 24th meets, we now have an on line "Parent Volunteer" doc in the "Meet Sign Up" where you can pick out where you may wish to help at a meet. We may also have a "Parent Volunteer" sign up sheet available in the activity room. a week prior to the championship meet.

It is at the discretion of the coaches as to who will swim in the championship meet.

Swimming in a championship meet is a privilege, not a right or entitlement. After entries have been made to the championship meet , changes are not allowed. When a swimmer has been entered in a championship meet there are many people counting on them. To decide not to come after line-ups have been sent is an extreme inconvenience and disappointment for all the coaches and swimmers involved in that meet line up. If a swimmer is entered in the meet, please send them ready to swim!

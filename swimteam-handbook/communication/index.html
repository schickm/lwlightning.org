<p>For Questions please call Head Coach Lance at <a href="tel:1-773-316-8348">(773) 316-8348</a> or email <a href="mailto:l.gross7000@yahoo.com">l.gross7000@yahoo.com</a></p>
<p>Communicating with our coaching staff can be done in many ways; stop at the pool, before or after practice, or by e-mail. Our most useful link will be e-mail. We also use file folders at the pool,(a mailbox system for awards, newsletters and information packets). File folders can be found in the activity room during practice and during off hours.</p>
<p>Also please check this site often.</p>

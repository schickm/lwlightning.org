#### Meet Signup

Meet signup is online this year, according to age.  Swimmers must use the password emailed to them, ( in order to log in) to fill in their name &amp; age group and indicate either YES or NO for each meet during the season. The coaches copy the sign ups three days before the meet in order to prepare the line ups. You can refer to the meet sign-up link anytime for reference or to re-do your original choices by filling out a new form.

The sign ups are copied 3 days before the meet in order to prepare the line ups.

<strong>PLEASE make any changes before coaches do their line ups<strong>.

Swimmers who forget to sign up may still be eligible to swim, provided there are lane openings. Please make sure you sign up.

Meets usually last 3 hours with warm ups at 4:30 and the meet beginning around 5:30pm.

Club Meets will be scheduled on Wednesday evenings; <strong>Again This Year We Have 3 Meets for our younger swimmers on some weekends.<strong> Refer to our Calendar on this site. 

Swimmers may swim maximum of 4 events:

* 2 relays and 2 individual events
* or 1 relay and 3 individual events

On meet days swimmers should bring warm clothing since it tends to get chilly in the evening. Please have all articles of clothing marked with swimmers name and team. Sleeping bags and blankets are encouraged for all meets.

All swimmers must check in and out with their coach at home and away meets.

Swimmers should bring a healthy snack or money to purchase food.

#### Home meets

Our home meets are a great experience for swimmers. We love exposing them to good competition right at our own pool! 
In order to continue to host though, we need parent support. Volunteering is required if your athlete is swimming in our home meets. Please feel free to sign up for the area you enjoy by completing the parent volunteer section under meet sign up on the home page of our website!  You will receive a log in by email.
Our returning parents will be happy to help explain the duties of each area. Any unreserved spots will be assigned on a rotating  basis so families can meet their volunteer requirement.
Swimmers may not be allowed in future home meets if parents have not successfully completed their volunteer commitment.
In order to run a successful home meet, we need PARENT participation! We need help from everyone!  Some volunteer positions include timing, officiating, ribbons, bull pen, runners, announcing, meet set up, meet take down, and swimmer supervision. 
If your swimmer is signed up for a home meet we may assign you a volunteer duty if you have not already volunteered. If you cannot be available on the day we assign you it is your obligation to find a substitute volunteer. 

Lincolnwood Parks &amp; Recreation does not allow food and beverages anywhere in the pool area. To accommodate patrons, Lincolnwood Parks &amp; Recreation does allow coolers in the pod &amp; concession area at the end of the pool. A water bottle (NO GLASS) is allowed on deck in the pool area at any time. Patrons who violate the food and beverage rule will be subject to ejection from the pool.

Usually after home meets, Swimmers and families satisfy their appetites with pizza and good conversation at Barnaby's restaurant, located at Oakton and Caldwell.

#### Away meets

We will provide one way transportation to the away meets unless you are notified by email. All Meet sign ups are done on line at the beginning of the season using a link provided. <b>Any Changes on line must be made the week prior to the meet.</b> These changes affect the entire age group your swimmer is in. A lot of entries including relays must be altered by the coach Please make sure you are on the "Email list". The bus leaves from the lot in front of the pool. Parents are encouraged to attend in order to watch their swimmers participate and bring them home.&nbsp; When necessary transportation can be provided to and from the meet. &nbsp; Directions to Away Meets are provided in the "Maps" section of this website.

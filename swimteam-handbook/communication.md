Communicating with our coaching staff can be done in many ways; stop at the pool, before or after practice, leaving a note in our mailboxes in the lifeguard office, or by e-mail. Our most useful link will be e-mail. We also use file folders at the pool (a mailbox system for awards, newsletters and information packets). File folders can be found in the activity room during practice and during off hours.

Email Jim at <a href="mailto:babaramdas4@gmail.com">babaramdas4@gmail.com</a>

Also please check this site often.

<p>It is with a saddened heart that we learn of the passing of one of our swimming communities' most dedicated coaches and officials. Kevin McBride passed away yesterday May 30th of a heart attack. Our regrets and condolences go out to Kim, Karissa, Kiel, &amp; Kameron &amp; their entire extended family . Kevin and I have worked together since the 1980 s when he started at High Ridge YMCA. He has always been available for any team I was involved with and always had the best interest of the children in mind. At the beginning of every swim season when we discussed scheduling, Kevin always said to me ....&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jim, I'll do what ever you need me to do".&nbsp; I heard those words 3 weeks ago and will hear them echo at the beginning of every season to come.</p>
<p>For all those who had the pleasure of working with Kevin ( and there are many) I am sure you know the dedicated heart that Kevin brought to any swim team, swim meet, or&nbsp; individual having a conversation with him.</p>
<p>The Lincolnwood Lightnings, Lincolnwood Park District, YMCA, and Illinois Swimming have lost a member that will be missed each and every day in the future.</p>

<p>Lots of Lightnings took advantage of the warm weather and the 82 degree Water in our pool this week. We had 5 days of Freestyle and Backstroke. The improvement in the body position and technique was noted by all the coaches. We were so impressed we took to the diving boards on Friday for some diving fun.&nbsp; This Tuesday we continue Free &amp; Back &amp; we begin Breaststroke.</p>

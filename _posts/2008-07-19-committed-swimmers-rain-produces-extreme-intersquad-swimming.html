<p>A committed Group of Lightning Parents and Swimmers turned out for  an unusual swim meet experience.   Spirits continued to be high, the temperature was fine and the water was warm. We all had a fantastic time. Everyone wanted to stay and swim.                                                                                     Click on the picture below for more about the meet</p>

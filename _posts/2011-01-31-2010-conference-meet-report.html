<h1><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><strong>About the 2010 Conference Meet<br />
Lincolnwood Lightnings were the host to all the A Conference Meet<br />
<&#47;strong>What great weather we had on the day of the meet Wednesday July 27th.<br />
I think it was because we had a plan for bad  weather in effect<br />
We&nbsp;hoped that if we would prepare for the temporary  thundershower it may not occur&nbsp; LOL<br />
Thank you for your compliments on our meet and your  cooperation in helping us run&nbsp;a successful&nbsp;meet<br />
We did have 3 officials cancel late in the day - I  want to thank those who stepped up to officiate<br />
The pool staff did an excellent job supporting the  meet<br />
Kevin, Lance, Kersti &amp; Tamar ran the meet  without a flaw<br />
And Paul was entertaining as usual with his  subliminal&nbsp; <span style="font-size: xx-small;">((barnaby's - barnaby's))<&#47;span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> message<&#47;span><br />
We had Peter, who was on the other end of Paul's Walkee Talkee at the team area to call events to the Bull Pen with his  blow horn<br />
Kate and Dena kept everyone happy all day<&#47;span> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">with heat prizes  &amp; T shirts,<br />
Mrs. Barbour was a runner all day, &amp; she labeled awards,  even for the other teams, and put as many awards in the mailboxes as she could<br />
The awards boxes were full - If you  forgot to pick up your awards at the BBQ last year, They will be in the conference room at the pool after the season begins<br />
Jess posted results, helped with the 8 &amp; Unders  &amp; was a runner as well<br />
Kim ran a&nbsp;an incredibly efficient&nbsp;bull pen for the entire day<br />
A special thanks to those who timed and to the coaches who helped our lightning's remain undefeated for yet another  year<&#47;span><&#47;h1></p>

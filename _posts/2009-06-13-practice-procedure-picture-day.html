<p>The parents meeting had a large turn out Monday night. Thank you to all that attended</p>
<p>The weather is beginning to cooperate and finially getting warmer as school is out. Please remember to enter the pool through the locker rooms before each practice from now on. In the mornings swimmers go directly to the pool and in the afternoons you must gather in the concession area. After Practice swimmers must exit the pool area through the activity room, where our mail boxes and meet sign up sheets are located.&nbsp; Please remember to indicate "YES" or "NO" each week for the next weeks swim meet. This will avoid sad swimmers and confusion on the following Wednesday swim meet</p>
<p>I forgot to mention at the meeting although this is in the handbook, to remember to pack healthy snacks on meet day and <em>pack their sweatpants or a form of warm clothing<&#47;em>. Some evenings are cool as the sun begins to go down around 6:30 -7PM</p>
<p><strong>Remember:<&#47;strong>&nbsp; Pick up you lightning apparel on Monday morning the 15th, Tuesday Morning or Tuesday afternoon.&nbsp; <strong><em>Most of the back ordered Suits are here now <&#47;em><&#47;strong></p>
<p><strong>Remember:<&#47;strong> Picture Day this Thursday June 18th (the day after our first meet). Boys will wear their T shirts and the girls No T shirts. Individual pictures begin at 4:30, Team Photo at 5:00. Please Wear your team suits or a dark colored jammer or one piece suit</p>
<p>We need everyone in the team photo whether you purchase a team photo or not. Please remember your friends would like to have you in their team photo. After the team photo is taken we will have free swim.</p>

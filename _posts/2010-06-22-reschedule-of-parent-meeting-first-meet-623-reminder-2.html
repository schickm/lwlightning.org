<p>Parents<&#47;p></p>
<p>It appears that the storm will be arriving at 4:30 to 5 or during our practice time tonight. With Friday traffic and the rain it will not be good to have this meeting. I believe the storm is moving quickly but the lightning detector may not clear the pool for us to have a sufficient practice either. As a result of this situation,  Practice is Canceled for tonight as well as the Parent Meeting<&#47;p></p>
<p>We will reschedule our parent meeting for Monday night 6&#47;21, same time 6:15pm.Your swimmers will be finishing practice as we meet.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Also Re: Wednesday 6&#47;23<&#47;p></p>
<p>If your swimmer wants to swim in this coming Wednesday's meet, Remember to have them sign up for the meet at Monday practice at the latest. The sign up sheets are in the activity room next to the concession area. The River Trails Sheets are removed on Monday and replaced with the next meets sheet, Norridge.<&#47;p></p>

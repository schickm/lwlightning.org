<p>We encourage swimmers to swim in groups of similar abilities, this facilitates training and instruction of appropriate technique. After the third week in June, practice groups begin to be more permanent. It sometimes takes several weeks for the coaches to place swimmers in their practice group. During the first 3 weeks of June, swimmers will be arriving to the team daily as their school gets out and also the week one swimmers will be improving. This makes group changes necessary. If the group time you are assigned does not work for you, summer school,work, carpooling, etc. speak to your swimmers coach before or after practice. We will do our best to accommodate. Morning Practice 6:30 Senior & Gold* Lanes 5 &6 7:00 Gold & Silver Lane 4 7:30 Bronze Lane 2 & 3 7:45 Blue 1 & 2 Diving Well 7:45 White 1 & 2 Lane 1 *Gold may start at either 6:30 or 7:00 (but not at 6:45) Also the lanes you swim in may change due to the group size for that morning, but not the time you start. Please try to arrive on time. Afternoon Practice: 5:00 &ndash; 6:30 Senior & Gold Lanes 5 & 6 Silver&hellip;</p>

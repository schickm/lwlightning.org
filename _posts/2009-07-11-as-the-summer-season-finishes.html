<p>The season has flown by and what a great season we have had. There is still  lots of fun left. Look at the calendar we have the <u>last dual meet<&#47;u> with River  trails, the <u>last Inter Squad<&#47;u> Meet, the <u>NISC Conference Meet<&#47;u>, the <u>Water Park Trip  &amp;&nbsp; Water Show<&#47;u> on the same day, <strong><u>and the amazing BBQ<&#47;u><&#47;strong>. ---Don't miss any of  these.</p>
<p>Look for the sign ups in the activity room for the Water Park or ask Coach Kim</p>
<p>And BBQ info will also be in the Activity Room soon, or ask Kate</p>

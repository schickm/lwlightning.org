<p>Woodland Trails Pool is located at 1500 East Euclid Avenue in Mt. Prospect.<br />
1 block west of Wolf Road and approximately 1 mile east of Route 83 (Randhurst Shopping Center) and 1 mile west of River Rd. (Rt. 45).<br />
They have a six lane, 25 meter pool</p>

Follow 45&nbsp; north to Euclid go west<br />
or<br />
4) create your own route there are many ways to get to Wolf Road &amp; Euclid (Lake Ave)</p>
<p>One of the river trails coaches told me they would take:<br />
Lincoln ave to Skokie Blvd<br />
Skokie Blvd&nbsp; to Dempster<br />
Dempster to Milwaukee<br />
Milwaukee to Lake<br />
Lake turns into Euclid</p>

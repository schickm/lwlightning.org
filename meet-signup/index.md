### Parent Volunteering

Below are the parent volunteer links, we ask that you volunteer for at least two meets. &nbsp;Without parents we could never host a meet. &nbsp;There are a variety of positions. We only&nbsp;request&nbsp;volunteers for weekday home meets.

NOTE: You can only signup for volunteering from a laptop or desktop computer.&nbsp; If you can't signup for any reason, then just email Annika directly with the dates and positions you'd like to volunteer for.&nbsp; Annika's email: <a href="mailto:annika.schick@gmail.com">annika.schick@gmail.com</a>

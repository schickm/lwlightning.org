### Progression through Stroke Clinic

Our clinic is designed to accommodate swimmers that have a basic ability of freestyle and backstroke and not recommended for those who wish a learn to swim program. Our swim team has swimmers from 5 yrs to 18 yrs and all have different levels of accomplishment

If you have any questions or concerns please contact Jim ( below the <a title="Registration &amp; Schedule" href="/stroke-clinic/registration-schedule/">schedule</a>) for more information prior to registration.

Our main goal is to make the transition from short course (25yd pools) to our long course pool, 50 meters. We do this by giving each swimmer the opportunity to improve their skills and technique so that they may swim more efficiently (with less struggle and less wasted energy) This will give each swimmer the opportunity to have more fun with less effort this summer.

The progression through the 4 strokes: stroke technique, reviewing drills, stroke components, starts, turns and finishes -- is designed for those that already have a basic skill level and development of the four strokes. Not everyone is ready for the more advanced strokes and drills. Our goal is to expose everyone to all four strokes and introduce the beginning swimmer to some of the components of these strokes, as they are ready for them. During any session there will always be some freestyle for all levels and in each successive session, new strokes and techniques will be added as swimmers progress at their own pace through the strokes they are ready for.

#### Session 1 Freestyle 5/23 &amp; 24

The first 2 days will be devoted to Freestyle only, for everyone. We will have lanes from beginning levels to advanced. Coaches may adjust swimmers to other lanes from time to time during these 2 weeks depending on the skills the coach feels an individual swimmer needs to work on.

#### Session 2 Backstroke 5/25, &amp; 26

We will continue freestyle and also begin Backstroke for those ready, as well as introduce backstroke stroke components to some beginning levels.

#### Begin Session 3 Breaststroke Friday 5/27
